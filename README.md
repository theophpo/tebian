# tebian
My very minimal own Debian distribution using live-build.

## Install
Your host should be on Debian 11 minimal, that's need minimal installations (live-build, debootstrap, linux-firmware).

`lb config && lb build`

Now, the hyrbid iso file is generated in the project root and can be used with virtualbox. (~15min after on my old Pentium)
